` command, I was pasting the entire file content each time, including parts that hadn't changed. This approach can sometimes:

1. Override recent changes if I accidentally use an older version of the file as my base
2. Make it harder to track what exactly changed in each update
3. Lead to inconsistencies if multiple changes are being made in sequence

To avoid this in the future, we should:

1. Always verify the current state of the file before making changes
2. Only update the specific parts of the code that need to change
3. Use more focused, smaller updates instead of rewriting entire files

For example, if we need to change just one function in PerformanceGraph.tsx, instead of rewriting the whole file, we should:
- First read the current state of the file
- Then make the specific change needed
- Make sure we're building upon the latest version

Would you like to proceed with the changes we were making to the graph component? I'll make sure to follow this improved approach to maintain consistency and avoid accidental reversions.
